# dart-problems-solved
Welcome to the **Dart Daily Challenge** repository! This project is dedicated to solving Dart problems every day to improve my programming skills in Dart and prepare for future projects and jobs. Each problem is designed to reinforce fundamental concepts and practical applications of Dart.

##  Purpose

The goal of this challenge is to build a strong foundation in Dart programming. By solving these problems daily, I aim to:
- Master core Dart concepts
- Develop problem-solving skills
- Prepare for future job roles and projects

##  Repository Structure

The repository is organized into daily folders where each folder contains solutions for that day’s problems.

- **`Day1/`**: Solutions for Day 1
- **`Day2/`**: Solutions for Day 2
- **...**: And so on

Each folder includes:
- `problemX.dart`: Dart code for problem X
